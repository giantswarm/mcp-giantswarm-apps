When creating a new issue:

1. Gather the necessary information for the issue: `title` and `body`. `labels` and `assignees` can also be included if provided.
2. Use the `create_issue` tool to create the new issue in the `giantswarm/envctl` repository. Set `owner` to `giantswarm` and `repo` to `envctl`.
3. Announce the new issue (title and number) in the chat after it has been created.
