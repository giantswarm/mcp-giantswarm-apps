When beginning work on a new task:

1. Use the `list_issues` tool to fetch the list of open issues from the `giantswarm/envctl` repository, ordered by issue number descending (newest first).
2. Decide which is the next best issue in that list (still open issue) and use the `get_issue` tool with its issue number to retrieve full details.
3. Summarize that issue (title, number, body, key tasks) in the chat before starting implementation steps.
4. After summarizing, outline the approach for addressing the issue and continue with the implementation.

This rule ensures every new coding session starts with up-to-date context from the roadmap.
